With a few changes:
1. Changing cost function to categorical cross-entropy
2. Changing output activations to a softmax function, rather than argmax
3. Slight modification to port from Python 2 to Python 3
    
Resources for doing this were found at https://deepnotes.io/softmax-crossentropy#the-softmax-function
